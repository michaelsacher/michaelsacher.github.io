            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Competed in VEX Robotics for 2 seasons, earning ~15 awards including an international signature event win at Sugar Rush and qualifying for the World Championship. Designed and built ~15 robots using Autodesk Inventor and Fusion, while leading my team as programmer, strategist, designer, and driver during the first season. Combined leadership with advanced technical skills by developing state-level competitive robots, creating innovative autonomous strategies, and applying advanced motion algorithms in C++ to consistently achieve high performance.</p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p><strong>Robots Designed:</strong> ~15 across 2 seasons, each applying unique drive bases and scoring mechanisms</p>
            <p><strong>Programming:</strong> C++ with PROS, implementing custom motion algorithms (PID, Pure Pursuit, Ramsete, Monte Carlo Localization, position resets, and path smoothing)</p>
            <p><strong>CAD Tools:</strong> Autodesk Inventor & Fusion for pre-build analysis and weakpoint identification</p>
            <p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Utilized additive manufacturing (3D printing) for rapid iteration and plastic optimization for weight reduction</p>
            <p><strong>Design Approach:</strong> Engineering design process reinforced by scouting high-level competitions and open collaboration with advanced teams</p>
                        
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>Followed the engineering design process from brainstorming through prototyping, applying CAD to identify structural weaknesses before building. During assembly, iterative adjustments were made to resolve overlooked issues. Actively researched high-level competitions and engaged with top-tier teams to refine strategies, while integrating consistent communication within the team to adapt designs quickly. Each subsystem (drive, intake, scoring) was tested and refined for reliability under competition conditions.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> In the first season, managing time across programming, building, driving, and team leadership often left little time for testing and refining code.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Prioritized scheduling and streamlined build processes to create more dedicated programming time, allowing for robust autonomous development.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> In the second season, autonomous consistency was hindered by odometry drift with an all-Omni wheel drivetrain.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented path smoothing and more rugged odometry handling in code to increase reliability, which became a cornerstone of competitive performance.</p>

            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>Skills gained from VEX Robotics — including CAD, motion algorithm development, and iterative engineering — are being applied to larger-scale projects such as aerospace prototypes and robotics research. Future projects will expand these experiences by incorporating advanced control systems, data-driven optimization, and cross-disciplinary engineering approaches.</p>
